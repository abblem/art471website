<p>best video ever made. learned so much. i just won the Guiness world record for World's Most Awesome Ass.</p><br>

<h3>and on that topic... here's some YouTube videos that were integral to shaping who I am as a person.</h3><br>

<p>i'm experiencing such a strange mixture of cringe and nostalgia at the same time.</p>
<p>also why is it all techno dance music LOL. i was watching this shit at age 12 thinking it was the coolest thing ever.</p>

<h3>i need to balance this out with a different kind of cringe</h3>

<p>why does putting a song in Eb tuning make it sound 1000000% better to my ears. something about the fact that its a raw riff tape instead of a polished demo is also appealing.</p>

<p>now that im a grown ass woman this is how i spend my time. i have updated my cringe resume.</p>

<p>i love these fuckers so much but i hate them at the same time. i love parasocial shame.</p>

<p>the fun part about being an adult is that this comes with some very fun emotional taxes. i obsess over these wack ass old men who have comitted many "cancelable" offenses, but it's okay because autism. guys im probably autistic, don't even worry about it. don't tell me not to love problematic old men because that's ableism. like don't hurt my man, he's had a hard life. dead mom, deadbeat dad, Cliff's death, alcoholism... he obviously can't be held accountable for his actions cause he's just a wittle guy. apparently i am just The Hypocrit™.</p>

<p>*please understand that this is sarcasm and i actually dont mean it, i just need help*</p>

<h3>all of a sudden the silly zone™ is feeling less silly. luckily i've got the antidote for that.</h3>
