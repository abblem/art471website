<h2>This is Where I Talk About Me</h2>
<p>Abby Lemieux is an artist based in Arundel, Maine. Her art practice unionizes artistic expression and natural sciences. She is interested in exploring environmental science topics, specifically climate anxiety, ecology, and sustainability. However, she has interests in many other areas including feminism and intrapersonal emotional conflicts. She makes work in many areas of art including drawing, ceramics, digital art, analog and digital photography, and fiber arts, but her preferred media are fibers–such as embroidery and crochet–and photography, especially analog and alternative printing methods.

Her work intertwines environmental science topics with the human experience. She embroiders on top of her landscape photos which are printed on fabric with cyanotyping or anthotyping, representing humans’ connections to and interpretations of our environment. Through her work, she aims to portray environmental communication ideas that are frequently unacknowledged in public dialogue of the climate crisis.
